## Context

Starting the Smart Table take-home assignment. Need to create a React TypeScript project with Vite that implements Excel-like functionality for a dynamic table.

## Initial Prompt

```
I need to create a Smart Table component for a take-home assignment that is attached with this prompt. The key requirements are:

1. React 18 + TypeScript project
2. Dynamic table with up to 10 rows and 10 columns
3. Initial state: 3 rows Ã— 4 columns (2 text + 2 number columns)
4. Excel-style cell references (A1, B2, etc.)
5. Basic arithmetic formulas (+, -, *, /)
6. Live calculations with circular reference prevention
7. Pixel-perfect UI matching provided screenshot
8. No heavy table libraries - build from React primitives

Help me set up the initial project structure with Vite and TypeScript. I want to use plain CSS for styling to ensure pixel-perfect accuracy. Also set up Jest for testing.

Help me design the architecture of this app and a complete roadmap. I would like to create the UI first and then increment with features.
```

## AI Response Analysis

The AI suggested:
- Vite + React 18 + TypeScript template
- Plain CSS for pixel-perfect styling
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing
- Modular component structure
- Custom hooks for state management
- Utility functions for formula engine

## Actions Taken

1. **Created Vite Project**: `npm create vite@latest rajdeep-smart-table -- --template react-ts`
2. **Project Structure Planning**: Designed component hierarchy
3. **Documentation Setup**: Created comprehensive README with time tracking and AI usage sections
4. **Development Journal**: Created DEVELOPMENT.md with architectural decisions and methodology
5. **AI Log Structure**: Set up tracking system with .ai-log/ folder
6. **Testing Configuration**: Added Jest + React Testing Library setup
7. **Project Cleanup**: Removed default Vite boilerplate, created clean minimal structure

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies and configure Jest
2. Create basic table structure
3. Implement cell editing functionality
4. Build formula engine
5. Add dynamic row/column management

## Key Decisions

- **Plain CSS over frameworks**: For pixel-perfect control
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better DX
- **Vite**: For fast development and build
- **Modular architecture**: For maintainability
- **Incremental development**: One feature at a time

## Code Generated

1. **Initial project structure** created with Vite template
2. **Custom README.md** with comprehensive documentation and time tracking placeholders
3. **DEVELOPMENT.md** with architectural decisions, development methodology, and phase planning
4. **AI tracking system** with .ai-log/ folder for documenting AI usage
5. **Clean project structure** with organized folders for components, hooks, utils, types, tests
6. **Jest configuration** for testing setup
7. **Minimal App.tsx** ready for development

## Learnings

- Start with comprehensive documentation
- Plan architecture before coding
- Set up proper tracking systems
- Use AI for strategic planning, not just coding
